TDAF NODE APP
=============

NodeJS (Express) in the Backend + AngularJS in the Frontend

I upload node_modules folder, as the auth module to access "movistar" auth entity has been developed inside the everyauth module and not as a plugin for it. Therefore, do not perforn any `npm install`

Backend is using everyauth and express 
Frontend developed using Yeoman for app scaffolding and Bower for Package Management

It will be running in 3000 port, and it's preconfigured to run also inside AppFoo Cloud

*Running* 
```bash
node app.js
```

*Usage*
Point browser to 
http://localhost:3000
